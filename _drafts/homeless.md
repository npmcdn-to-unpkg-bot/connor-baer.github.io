I had been thinking about buying a homeless person something to eat or drink for a while. I was hesitant until now, and never actually did it. I always thought I didn't have the time because I also wanted to take the time and talk to the person to get to know them and their situation. 

Finally I made up my mind and bought a homeless man in front of a Starbucks in New York a Caramel Latte, that he wished for when I asked him if I could buy him something to eat or drink. He was delighted and thanked me. I did not stop to talk to him though. Next time. One step at a time. Change happens overtime. 

I feel nervous, unsure of myself and of what I have just done. Surprisingly I am not happy but sad. Sad, that I cannot help in a more profound way. Crushed by the amount of work that needs to be done to eliminate poverty. But again, one step at a time. Many small actions create a big impact. 

I will make this a habit.
